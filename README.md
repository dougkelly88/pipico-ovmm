# July 2024 work experience tutorias

On [Project AOC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/aim/) we are exploring using an analog-optical computer as alternative hardware to GPUs to accelerate machine learning inference and solving difficult optimisation problems. 

A key part of this machine is the *optical vector-matrix multiplier* (OVMM): here, we will use a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and some simple, cheap electronics to build an example OVMM machine.
